# Presentation: Help! How do I know What Kind of Dev do I Want to be?

This is a collection of the issues, links and materials I will use to complete a workshop about the different types of developers that students are choosing from.

### Description:
Front-end developer? Back-end developer? Data engineer? Security? DevOps? Full-stack? Auto? QA?

Join me to help you get an idea of what kind of developer you want to pursue! We will take 10 minutes for each sub-section of developing and work through a real-life bug and fix it and then you will have a better idea of what developing is in each of these jobs.

### Links
Throughout the presentation I will be linking to a lot of things. Here they all are: https://bit.ly/WhatKindOfDevLinks

### Tools:
- I thought about using [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) to do live coding (for front end and security bugs) but I am going to go with github codespaces instead because it will allow students to get more green squares.
 - I eventually want to get a testing environment set up with [cypress](https://cloud.cypress.io/), maybe [observable](https://observablehq.com/) could help with that?
